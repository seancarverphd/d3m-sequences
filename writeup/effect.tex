\title{The effect of pipeline-collection-diversity on performance}

\abstract{Do performers who submit \emph{diverse} collections of
  pipelines tend to perform better than those who submit less diverse
  collections of pipelines? The answer for the Winter 2020 evaluation
  is effectively no. While there does exist statistically significant
  effect of increased diversity on increased score, the effect size is
  trivial. Thus, it seems that less diverse collections of pipelines,
  i.e. those that focus more on hyperparameter tuning, can be as
  effective as those that explore a greater diversity and/or ordering
  of primitives. }

\section{Introduction}
In section \ref{sec:measures}, \emph{Measures of Diversity}, we define
several measures of the diversity within a collection of three or more
pipelines. In section \ref{sec:glance}, \emph{Results at a Glance}, we
present a heat map showing briefly the (weak) connection between
diversity and performance. In section \ref{sec:quantifying},
\emph{Quantifying the Effect of Diversity}, we report on regression
results which point to the measurable, though substantively trivial,
effect of diversity on score. In a final section
\ref{sec:visualization}, \emph{Visualizing Collections} we show a
visualization of collections of pipelines for a problem together with
a multiple alignment, for context.

\section{Measures of Diversity}
\label{sec:measures}
Before we can define \emph{diversity} of a collection of (say 3 to 20)
pipelines, we first need to define the distance between a pair of
pipelines.  We choose the Levenshtein edit distance as this measure
between two pipelines.  Specifically, we first express the pipelines
as sequences of primitives, where primitives are written as
``letters'' in a large alphabet.  The software we use accommodates all
D3M primitives with two-letter pairs, each pair representing a single
token (primitive) of the alphabet.  The Levenshtein edit distance is
the minimum number of substitutions, insertions and/or deletions
needed to bring one sequence to coincide with the other.  This measure
satisfies the axioms for a distance.

But \emph{distance} involves just two pipelines; \emph{diversity}
measures variation among a collection of three or more pipelines.  We
tried several alternatives for quantifying diversity.  The most
well-behaved measures (i.e.\ the ones that behave most closely to our
expectations on synthetic data) were vector norms where the vector
components were the Levenshtein distances for all possible unordered
pairs of pipelines in the collection.

More precisely, we used $l_p$ norms where $p$ was a parameter varying
between 1 and $\infty$.  The different norms measure slightly different
quantities.  At the extreme, the $l_\infty$ norm (maximum
edit-distance component) is large when there is at least one pair of
pipelines at great distance, regardless of the positions (great or
small) of the other as-close or closer distances.  On the other hand,
the $l_1$ norm (sum of the edit-distance components) can still be
relatively large if there are many pairs pipelines at moderate
distance, even though there is no pair at great distance.  We point
out that the choice the different norms can sometimes matter: we have
noted that the choice can order sets of collections---synthetic or
real---differently in terms of diversity.

%Note that absolute values found in textbook definitions of the $l_p$
%norm:
%$$l_p([v_1,\dots,v_n]) = \sqrt[p]{|v_1|^p + \dots + |v_n|^p}$$ remain
%unnecessary because all distances (e.g.\ the Levenshtein edit distance
%components of $v$) must be non-negative by the properties of distance.

In the $l_p$ norm, what value for the parameter $p$ do we pick?  If
you are using only one measure of diversity, we recommend the $l_2$
norm as a nice tradeoff between the two extremes.  That said, it is
more informative to report two or more measures of diversity, in which
case $l_1$ and $l_\infty$ should be preferred because they are most
independent.

\section{Results at a Glance}
\label{sec:glance}
Figure \ref{fig:heatmap} shows the diversity of performer pipeline
submissions by problem type. The color-coding indicates diversity,
with purple colors indicating small $l_2$ edit distance norms,
trending towards yellow colors indicating larger $l_2$ edit distance
norms.The number of asterisks in each cell captures the count of times
a pipeline in that performer-category was the best (or tied). For
instance, in the second row of the first column, UCB twice had the
best-performing pipeline on a dataset in the binary\_classification
problem category. Overall, the figure suggests (and we quantify below)
a very small but measurable effect of diversity.

  Diversity'' for a discussion of this and other measures we use to

  the vertical axis is performer for the Winter 2020 evaluation.  The
  number of asterisks in each cell is the number of problem instances
  in the corresponding category-performer which was the best (or tied
  for best) performing pipeline for any problem.  There were 37 ties
  (including multi-way ties), corresponding to an additional 37
  asterisks in the figure beyond the total number of 103 problems.}

\section{Quantifying the Effect of Diversity}
\label{sec:quantifying}
We use regression-based methods to quantify the effect of diversity on
performance. This analysis is complicated by several factors, which we
address by various, overlapping methodological choices. Overall, our
goal is to specify predictive models of performance on the bases of
the $l_1$ and $l_\infty$ norms, as well as the number of pipelines
submitted. Our unit of analysis is the collection of pipelines
submitted by a performer, which features diversity measures mentioned,
a count, and the score obtained by its best member. We group these by
problem across performer for analysis. The diversity measures and
scores are not comparable across problems, or problem types; thus, we
move to measuring all predictors and scores on a per-problem z-score
basis.

Below, we report on five classes of statistical models. In the first,
we group all problem types together for analysis in a ``complete
pooling'' model; see MODEL A. We can see that there is a significant
effect of diversity on performace (P-VALUE), but the coefficent is
small (INTERPRET).

We ran a complete pooling model including fixed effects for problem
type, and saw no change in our key predictors. We evaluated the
possibility of multicollinearty by running PCA over our predictors and
using the first principal component as an omnibus measure of
diversity, and found (whatever we found; see MODEL B).

We then ran a no pooling model (MODEL C).

We then ran a hierarchical model with random effects on the intercept
(MODEL D).

Finally we can a hierarchical model with random effects on both the
intercept and slope (MODEL E).

\begin{table}
  \begin{tabular]{c|c|c|c|c}
    Model & Coefficient & p-value & estimate & std error \\
    A & $l_1$ & & & \\
    B & $l_1$ & & & \\
    C & $l_1$ & & & \\
    D & $1_1$ & & & \\
    E & $l_1$ & & &
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{This is table 1.}
\end{table}
\section{Visualizing Collections}
\label{sec:visualization}
In this final section, we show a cartoon visualization of collections
of pipelines for a problem together with a multiple alignment.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{seebelow.pdf}
\caption{The next several pages show a cartoon figure of a multiple
  sequence alignment of all submitted pipelines (all performers) for
  one randomly selected problem {\bf
    semi\_1217\_click\_prediction\_small\_MIN\_METADATA}.  The circles
  in the first pane illustrate the pipelines and are referenced with
  the number that corresponds to the label in the multiple alignment
  in the second pane.  The colors correspond to different performers
  (also labeled in the second pane). The alphabet used to label
  primitives is shown on the third pane, which was randomly generated.
  The position of the circles was determined by a spring layout
  procedure with pipelines close in edit distance supposedly remain
  close as nodes.  That said, usually impossible solve this problem
  perfectly (at least in two dimensions) and we have noted that the
  software returns some misleading results while presumably trying to
  draw a pretty picture (what it was designed to do).  Nevertheless,
  we found these figures useful for keeping pipelines in memory---as
  long as the image is interpreted as a ``cartoon'' and not a
  ``topographical map.''  Cartoons for the other problems are
  available upon request.}
