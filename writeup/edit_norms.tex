\maketitle

Here we consider and compare various measures of pipeline diversity.
We assume a pipeline is a sequence of one or more primitives.
Diversity means diverstiy in the sequence chosen, and it is the
diversity within one collection, compared to another.  Ususally the
collections are defined by the performer.

Consider the following scenarios.

\begin{enumerate}
\item 
  Performer X1 submits pipelines A and B differing by 20 substitutions.
\item
  Performer X2 submits pipelines C1 through C20 all differing by 1
  substituion from each other.
\item
  Performer X3 submits pipelines A1 through A19 with identical
  sequences and B differing by 20 from the A's.
\item
  Performer X4 submits pipelines A1 through A10 and B1 through B10,
  where the A's differ from the B's by 20 but within each letter they
  are identical sequences.
\item
  Performer X5 submits 20 different pipelines each with a successive
  substution in a different position.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
  Performer & ``$L_0$'' & $L_1$ & $L_2$ & $L_\infty$ \\
  \hline
  X1 & 1 & 20 & 20 & 20 \\
  X2 & 190 & 20 & & 1 \\
  X3 & 19 & & & 20 \\
  X4 & 100 & & & 20 \\
  X5 & 190 & & & 20
\end{tabular}
