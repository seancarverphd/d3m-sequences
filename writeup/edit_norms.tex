If a pipeline is sequence of primitives, how do we quantify the
diversity of a collection of pipelines, in terms of its primitives?
We have to decide what we mean by diversity.  Is a collection of only
two pipelines very diverse if all their primitives are different?  How
about a collection of many pipelines that differ in only one
primitive---is that more or less diverse?

The use the Levenshtein edit distance between pairs of pipelines gives
us a number describing the difference (diversity) between the pairs of
pipelines, in terms of primitives.

What about a collection?  We have a different edit distance for each
of $N$ pairs in the collection.  We put these $N$ numbers into a
vector $v$ of length $N$---the quantity $N$ is related to the number
of pipelines, $n$, by $N = \frac{(n)(n-1)}{2}$.

As a first idea, we can take the sum or average of the components of
this vector.  The sum is simply the $L_1$ norm (see below) because all
components are non-negative.  We can generalize this to the $L_p$ norm
for any $p$.
$$L_p(v) = \left(|v_1|^p + |v_2|^p + \dots
|v_N|^p\right)^\frac{1}{p}.$$ What about generalizing the averages?
$$M_p(v) = \frac{L_p(v)}{N}.$$ The quantities $L_p(v)$ and $M_p(v)$
are is defined for all $0 < p < \infty$ but $L_p(v)$ satisfies the
properties of a norm only for $p \geq 1$. Two limits can be considered
for $L$ and by extention $M$ (the second is not really a limit nor is
it a norm, but is often used).
$$L_\infty(v) = \max\left\{|v_1|, |v_2|, \dots, |v_N|\right\}$$
$$L_0(v) = \mbox{the number of non-zero elements of $v$}.$$

\section{Synthetic Scenarios}

Now we test these measures on synthetic data.  Consider the following
scenarios.  All pipelines below have 10 unique primitives.
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
  Performer X submits only 2 pipelines---differing by 10 substitutions.
\item
  Performer Y submits 6 pipelines all differing from each other by 10
  substitutions.
\item
  Performer Z submits 5 identical pipelines plus 1 additional pipeline
  differing from all the rest by 10 substitutions.
\item
  Performer W submits 2 sets of 3 identical pipelines differing by 10
  substutions between groups.
\item
  Performer U submits a sequence of pipelines differing from each
  other by a number of substitions equal to the absolute value of the
  relative position in the sequence.
\item
  Performer V submits a sequence of pipelines all differing from each
  other by a single substitution.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{eqnarray}
  L_1 & : & Y > W > Z > U > V > X \\
  L_2 & : & Y > W > Z > U > X > V \\
  L_3 & : & Y > W > Z > X > U > V \\
  L_\infty & : & Y = W = Z = X > U > V \\
  L_0 & : & Y = U = V > W > Z > X \\
  M_1 & : & X = Y > W > Z > U > V \\
  M_2 & : & X > Y > W > Z > U > V \\
  M_3 & : & X > Y > W > Z > U > V \\
  M_\infty & : & X > Y = W = Z > U > V \\
  M_0 & : & X = Y = U > V > W > Z 
\end{eqnarray}
